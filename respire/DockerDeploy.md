## Docker Deployment Guideline

### 1. Build the Docker Image

```sh
docker build -t respire-app .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 respire-app
```

- The app will be available at http://localhost (or the device's IP address).
- Make sure Docker is installed on the new device before running these commands.


## How to use SPIRE
1. `Main Toolbar`(top)
    - We provide three tasks in this version, and you can access them through `File` button (the first one in the toolbar).Select one task from them.
    - You can save the space by clicking the `Save Draft` button. The saved space can be uploaded by `File` -> `Upload Snapshot`.
    - When you finish your Space to Think, you can click `Generate Report` to let ChatGPT generate report for you.
    - Click `show report` button in the rightmost, you can see the generated report. It will be blank before the report generation.

2. Uploading Your Own Documents
    - You can upload your own documents through `File` -> `Upload documents`
    - Documents should be in a JSON file with the following format:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "label": "Document_1",
            "content": "Content of the first document..."
        },
        {
            "label": "Document_2",
            "content": "Content of the second document..."
        }
    ]
    ```
    - Requirements:
        - File must be valid JSON
        - Must be an array of document objects
        - Each document must have `label` and `content` properties
        - Labels should be unique identifiers for each document
        - Content can include any text, including newlines and special characters
    - An example file is provided at `src/modules/Space2Think/dataset/example_documents.json`

3. Instruction for using the space
    - `Edit menu` (top left in the space): support Undo and Redo. 
    - `UI bar` (top middle in the space): tools for the space. From left to right:
        - Arrow cursor: select documents
        - Hand cursor: move the camera
        - Create Connection
        - Create frame for clustering
        - Create stickers
        - Eraser
    - `Highlight menu`: double-click a document to activate text selection mode, where your cursor will change to a text selection cursor. Select one or more words, then right-click to open the highlight menu.
    - `Bird view` (bottom left in the space)

4. After you build your Space to Think (only the documents within frame will be generated by LLM), you can generate your report through clicking `GENERATE` button!
